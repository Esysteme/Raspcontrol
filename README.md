Raspcontrol has been drastically improved since the inital release, we now have improved security, standalone deployment and many new awesome features!

### Getting Started Guide
##### Typical Requirements:

Raspcontrol is intended to be used with the PHP 5.4 inbuilt web server.

If your distribution does not support PHP 5.4 then you will need to build it from source or use a HTTP server such as Apache to access Raspcontrol.
